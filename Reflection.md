1. What Does My Code Do?
The code I’ve written is essentially a digital resume designed as a webpage. It uses HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling. The main aim of this webpage is to present a clean and organized layout of my personal information, professional background, and skills. Here’s a breakdown of the main components:

`Header`: The page starts with my name in bold and large font, centered at the top. It’s an introduction to the viewer right away, making it clear who the resume belongs to.

`Profile Picture`: An image is included to showcase a professional profile photo. It's placed in the center of the page, giving the user a visual connection with the resume.

`Sections`: The sections of the resume cover important aspects such as:

`About`: A brief overview of myself, summarizing my skills and background.
`Skills`: An animated SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) that visually represents my proficiency in key areas like customer service, communication, and problem-solving.
`Work Experience, Education, and Personal Details`: These sections list my job experiences, educational background, and personal info like language skills.
`Links`: There are external links to my online profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn) to give users easy access to my professional networks.

`Footer`: Finally, the footer contains contact details, such as my phone number and email, allowing potential employers or contacts to reach out.

2. What Was My Coding Process?
I started by planning the content and structure, organizing the resume into clear sections. I then used HTML to build the structure and CSS to style the page. An SVG animation was added to showcase skills visually. I tested the page to ensure it looked good across devices.

3. What Challenges Did I Have?
Background Image: Ensuring the image covered the page properly was tricky, but using background-size: cover solved it.
SVG Animation: Getting the animation smooth and properly functioning required some trial and error.
Image Alignment: Centering the profile image took some adjustments, which were resolved with margin: 0 auto;.

4. What Would I Do Differently Now?
External Stylesheets: I’d separate the CSS into an external file for cleaner code.
Better Accessibility: I would add more ARIA attributes and descriptive alt text for better accessibility.
Responsive Design: I’d improve responsiveness using media queries for different screen sizes.
Optimize Images: I’d compress images and optimize them for faster loading.

1. What My Code Does
The code creates a personal resume webpage using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. It includes sections for personal details, skills, work experience, and education, styled with custom fonts, a consistent color palette, and a responsive layout. Media queries ensure the site adapts to various screen sizes, while accessibility features like semantic tags and ARIA roles improve usability.

2. My Coding Process
I followed a structured approach, starting with the design guidelines, then moving to layout and styling. I focused on responsiveness and accessibility, regularly testing on multiple devices. I used Git for version control and committed frequently.

3. Challenges
One challenge was ensuring cross-device compatibility and making the layout fully responsive. I overcame this by using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, testing the site on various screen sizes.

4. What I Would Do Differently
Next time, I would spend more time planning the layout and accessibility features before coding to ensure a smoother development process. Additionally, I would experiment with more advanced CSS effects to enhance the design further.
